Simple Encryption and Decryption Project
This project is a simple encryption and decryption tool that allows users to encrypt plaintext messages and decrypt encrypted messages using a chosen encryption algorithm.

Features
Encrypt plaintext messages using a chosen encryption algorithm
Decrypt encrypted messages using the corresponding decryption algorithm
Support for multiple encryption algorithms (e.g., Caesar cipher, Substitution cipher)
User-friendly interface for inputting messages and selecting encryption/decryption options

Technologies Used
React
Encryption and Decryption Algorithms (e.g., Caesar cipher, Substitution cipher)
